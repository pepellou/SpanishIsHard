# Reasons to quit

I don't want you to quit.

So bear in mind that these are the reasons why most people quit:

1. Wanting results too fast
2. Trying to be perfect
3. Feeling it's too late to learn
4. Bad experiences

Don't get me wrong, if you suffer of any, some or all of those, there's more or less nothing I can do.
But let me share how I overcame them in case if helps.

## Wanting results too fast

This is a very common "disease", as we live in a world where immediacy is valued and practiced more than patience.
The same as many other "big" life challenges (play an instrument, learn chess, get in shape, etc.) it's nearly impossible to perceive any progress in the short term.
But if you persevere through daily practice, no matter how little, you'll be able to see results in the long-term.

I'm a very patient person and yet the first week with a new daily routine is always tough.
You just have to start with good motivation.

## Trying to be perfect

There's nothing wrong with trying to be perfect... as long as it's not your final goal.
It's important to realize you cannot master a new language the way you master your native one, and that's ok.
It's also very important to realize that if you start at 0% and native level is 100%, you will be able to have conversations somewhere between 10% and 20%.
Even native speakers make mistakes (think about you on your own language) and there's no problem at all to make mistakes, as people will still understand you.

Of course, perfectionists will have to fight against self-consciousness.
But put yourself in your listener's shoes - they're not judging your language skills, but rather trying to have a conversation with you.
And if any, they're probably grateful that you're making the big effort of learning and trying to speak their language.

## Feeling it's too late to learn

If you're an adult, it is true that you no longer have the extraordinary learning abilities of a child's brain.
But what children have in learning power, they lack in experience, focus, perspective and deduction.
You have a lot of knowledge that will help you with the task.

Yes, a sponge-like brain would be handy to speed up the learning, but just the right attitude and perseverance will get you there anyway.

## Bad experiences

It is possible that you tried to learn this or another foreign language in the past and you had a bad experience.
Sometimes it can be simply giving up after a tough time trying, and sometimes it can be a more traumatic experience, like feeling shame or humiliation due to a poisonous environment.

Whatever the reason is, bad experiences can discourage you from learning or from taking important steps in the way (such as having fear of asking questions or having a bad accent).
This may not be the most common cause of quitting (and in my case I honestly never suffered it), but it can certainly make it really challenging.

An important thing to remember is that if you're struggling that's already a win.
It means you're making the effort and that's just the recipe to succeed.
You'll make a lot of mistakes, every day, but that's ok - it's just the way to learn.
