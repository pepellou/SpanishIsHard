# Why is this so tricky?

Let's say you encounter the Spanish word "cara".
The translator may tell you it means "face", but it may give you a second definition: "expensive".

Or let's say you encounter the word "d√≥lar", which means "dollar".
That sounds easy enough, until you encounter "dolor", which means "pain".

Why do they make these different words so similar? It's tricky!

Well, first of all, remember rule one. Don't ask why, it will not help.

Second, you have the exact same issues in English, but they're not hard for you because... well you don't remember when you were learning the language for the first time.
The first example I gave is called polysemy (same word with different meanings, as English words "date", "fly", "serve", etc).
The second is an example of just similar words (like lose/loose, bear/bare, affect/effect, etc).
In English you even have words like dessert, which is technically 2 different words (as they're pronounced differently) but with the same written form.

All this lexical ambiguity and confusion is not a problem in the language you already master, of course, but it's a bit of a challenge in a new one.

There's no way around it. You'll have to learn word by word, and sometimes meaning by meaning.
Just embrace the differences and they will help you remember them.
