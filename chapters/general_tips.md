# General tips

I gave you 2 tips already. Let me summarize them for you:

 1) Don't ask why. Embrace the differences.
 2) Practice your vocabulary every day, even if it's only for a minute.

Before we dive in concrete topics of the Spanish language, let me give you a couple more general advices for learning languages in general:

## Start with phonetics

Even if you don't understand what they're saying, it's of great value to listen to pop songs, radio stations or TV shows.
You may not realize it, but your brain also learns from what things you're not consciously understanding.
That's how linguistic immersion works at first.
Your brain will recognize patterns that keep repeating, even if there's no conscious effort on making sense of them, and will be more likely to identify or reproduce them in the future.

In the other hand, the more you delay speaking the harder it'll become.
Even if you're silently reading, you're internally wording what you read.
The sooner you start wording things "the right way" (or let's call it a "decent-enough way"), the easier it'll be to keep adding on top of that.
