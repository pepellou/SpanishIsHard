# General tips

I gave you 2 tips already. Let me summarize them for you:

 1) Don't ask why. Embrace the differences.
 2) Practice your vocabulary every day, even if it's only for a minute.

Before we dive in concrete topics of the Spanish language, let me give you a couple more general advices for learning languages in general:

## Start with phonetics

Even if you don't understand what they're saying, it's of great value to listen to pop songs, radio stations or TV shows.
You may not realize it, but your brain also learns from things you're not consciously understanding.
That's how linguistic immersion works at first.
Your brain will recognize patterns that keep repeating, even if there's no conscious effort on making sense of them, and will be more likely to identify or reproduce them in the future.
The same way a dog is taught new verbal commands by just hearing them along with the corresponding action, our brain will learn and predict patterns making it more natural to "flow" through them in the future.

On the other hand, the more you delay speaking, the harder it'll become.
Even if you're silently reading, you're internally wording what you read.
The sooner you start wording "the right way" (or let's call it a "decent-enough way"), the easier it'll be to keep building on top of that.

## Write

Making conversation involves more challenges than just learning the vocabulary.
After you have a decent sustainable pace learning vocabulary, you may want to challenge yourself to write a journal, a fake letter, a book review, etc.

The real struggle of actually expressing "real" things in writing will level up your learning a lot.
Have a dictionary (or google translate) nearby and don't worry if writing the simplest of texts takes you half an hour.
The effort is really worth it.

It's definitely not an activity to do every day, but if you can save a bit of time per week or every other week, writing is a great exercise to speed up your learning.

## Pick your favourite topics

When you have so much to learn ahead of you, there's no unique learning path.
So why not making it the most entertaining?

One thing I like to do when learning a new language is coming up with a list of 100 sentences I want to learn how to say.
But I don't necessarily include the usual "basic conversation" stuff.
Instead I have on my list things like "I am a chess player" or "I like math".

You can get to be very specific with the topics you like and that will not only be an extra of motivation for you to learn, but you can also make a good impression very soon.
Imagine that after a week of learning the language you get to say "I am proud of my gardening skills" (or any other specific thing you come up with).
Any listener would think you've been learning the language for a year!
