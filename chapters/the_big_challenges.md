# The big challenges

We can't know what we don't know.

Remember the first advice? Forget everything you know about English, because Spanish is not English.

If you don't know what to expect from Spanish, you'll think it'll be like English.
You will think some parts will be hard just because they are hard in English (such as spelling, for example) and you will ignore there are parts that will actually be more complex than English.

Forget any pre-judice you have. These are going to be your biggest challenges:

 1) Spanish is spoken "too fast"
 2) The logic behind similar words is tricky
 3) Spanish has many dialects
 4) The grammar is complex

Everything else will not be as hard as you think (and we will see it also in further chapters).
These big 4 however... oh yes, you will struggle with these.
But it's best if I tell you up-front and we understand them a bit so at least you have a plan.
