# The big challenges

We can't know what we don't know.
So don't you think you know how hard it's going to be, or what challenges you will face.
Because you don't know.

A common mistake for a new learner is to think that Spanish is like English.
You may not think that consciously, but internally your brain will try to frame the new knowledge according to the only language you already know.
Your brain will think that some parts will be hard just because they are hard in English (such as spelling, for example, that is actually much simpler in Spanish).
And your brain will pay no attention at all at those parts that are simple in English (such as verb tenses, definitely more complex in Spanish).

Those prejudices, conscious or not, will give you a hard time even with the simplest parts of the language, because you'll make them more complicated than they are.

So let me be clear about what's really going to be difficult for you.
These are going to be your biggest challenges:

 1) Spanish is spoken "too fast"
 2) The logic behind similar words is tricky
 3) Spanish has many dialects
 4) The grammar is complex

Everything else (spelling, gender, omitting pronouns, accents, etc) will not be as hard as you think (but we will see them also in further chapters).
But those 4 challenges... oh yes, you will struggle with them.

In any case, it's best if I tell you up-front about it, so let's understand them a bit to at least have a plan.
