# Misconceptions

The more languages you learn, the easier it is to learn a new language.
Is this because you trained certain parts of your brain? Certainly to some extent.
But to me the main difference are misconceptions: if it's your first time learning a language other than English, you're extremely likely to try and frame any new knowledge into your "English mindset".

But languages are different in their phonetics, grammar, etc
If you think you'll learn a new language by just learning new words until you learned enough, you'll encounter many difficulties.

You're lucky, as Spanish is not "that" different from English, but it'll still be a pain if you default to framing what you learn into the English rules.
Even parts of the language that are simpler than in English will be hard for you if you don't realize they are!

Throughout this book, I'll show what parts of Spanish will be a real test for the English learner, but also in which parts you're better off forgetting what you know and starting with a cleaner simpler mindset.

So the first advice I have for you: don't ask why.

Every language has had centuries of evolution that result in a very complex set of rules.
When something new of the language shocks you, don't ask "why is this like that? it makes no sense".
Linguists devote years of study and research to answer that kind of "why" question, but your goal here is to just use the language.
Don't try to make a sense of it or you'll go crazy.

Some practical questions you can use instead when facing something shocking could be:

 - Can I find more examples like this?
 - How can I remember this?
