# Spanish is spoken too fast

I have to be honest.
Whenever someone complains a new language sounds "too fast" I think it's a bit unfair: you're just a beginner, it's not the language's fault that you can't still understand it fluently.
Your brain will definitely need some practice until you improve your listening speed.

But one thing is true about Spanish: it has more synalephas than English.

A synalepha is when a word is phonetically linked to the next one so it's hard to identify the words when listening to them.
This phenomenon used to be common in English poetry in the 18th century, when words like "the elite" would be pronounced like "thelite".
Spanish (and many other Romance languages) not only feature this phenomenon (for example, "la élite" sounds like "laélite", where "lae" sounds like a single syllable), but it features it all the time.
The amount of words that end in a vowel in Spanish makes it very likely to link two words whenever the second one starts with a vowel.
But the effect exists also with consonants (for example "el libro" sounds like "elibro").

Your usual book to learn Spanish will not explain this, but it's by far the most challenging feature when it comes to understanding spoken Spanish.

My advice for you is that you bear this in mind and put special attention to it.
The sooner you practice speaking the words like that, the faster your brain will get used to listening to them the same way.
And if you're a grammar nerd, you can practice splitting syllables in Spanish as an exercise that will help you (the rules are much less ambiguous than in English, so you'll actually feel rewarded soon).
