# Vocabulary

Reading and writing words, as well as knowing their meaning, may not be as hard as speaking them out loud or understanding them when listening.
At least not for a word, or a bunch of words.
But if you want to learn thousands of words (and well, you probably want that), then it becomes definitely the biggest effort in learning a new language.

You're lucky many Spanish words will resemble some English words due to a common origin, but even similarities may sometimes deceive you, and in the end there's no way around studying vocabulary: you'll need to learn word by word.

You may be upset there's no shortcut for this, but I'll tell you vocabulary is usually not the reason people quit learning a language.
And I'm sure you already know that the amount of words you need for basic conversation is not that much.
You can keep learning new vocabulary all the time.

So I'll trust you're here motivated to take on the challenge.
And trust me, there may not be a shortcut, but I'll tell you how to do it efficiently.

The most important concept here is "sustainable pace".
No matter how clever you are, you won't be a good pianist if you don't practice your scales every day.
You won't be a good chess player if you don't practice your tactics every day.
And so on...

A little effort every day will make a huge difference over a big effort once in a while.

Think about it.
If I tell you now that "soso" is the Spanish word for "bland", you will probably remember it if I ask you in 5 minutes.
If I ask you tomorrow, maybe you'll remember maybe you won't, but if I ask you in a month and you never used the word again, you won't remember it.

When we learn new words we don't want them stored in our short-term memory, but in our long-term one.
The way to move them there? Repetition.

The efficient way is to use what's called "spaced repetition", which is a scientific way to say that each word will be repeated more frequently when you're learning it for the first time or when you fail to remember them.
Most languages apps (Duolingo, Mondly, Babel, ...) will do this to some extent for you, but you can just use a generic flashcards software (Anki) or the good old physical flashcards.
The latter is my preferred method, because manual interaction reinforces memory as well.
You can go over your flashcards and make piles with your failures. Make sure to start reviewing failures each day.

In no time you'll be remembering words you saw a week or two ago. Then you'll know you're storing them in the right place.
