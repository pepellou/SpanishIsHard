> Book to help Spanish learners overcome the very first and biggest obstacles

## Building...

This repo is on a very early stage, but it'll very soon include:

 - Outline of chapters
 - Compiler
 - Notes (Zettelkasten Method)

## Come help

Even though this is a personal quest and a highly opinionated work
(that is, content decisions are currently being made by one single brain and we're not looking for more at the moment),
all the help is appreciated.

You can help if:

 - You're an English speaker learning Spanish (your feedback is very valuable)
 - You're a designer, editor or in general you have an opinion or suggestions to improve
 - You're just a person with any valuable feedback at all :-)

The main work is being done in notes so far (brainstorming stage).

Contact me at [@pepellou](https://twitter.com/pepellou) for any feedback.
