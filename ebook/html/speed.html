<h1>Spanish is spoken too fast</h1>
<p>I have to be honest. Whenever someone complains syaing that a new
language sounds “too fast” I think it’s a bit unfair: you’re just a
beginner. It’s not the language’s fault that you can’t understand it
fluently yet! Your brain needs ome practice until you improve your
listening speed.</p>
<p>But one thing is true about Spanish: it has more synalephas than
English.</p>
<p>A synalepha is when a word is phonetically linked to the next one so
it’s hard to identify the words when listening to them. This phenomenon
used to be common in English poetry in the 18th century, when words like
“the elite” would be pronounced like “thelite”. Spanish (and many other
Romance languages) not only feature this phenomenon (for example, “la
élite” sounds like “laélite”, where “lae” sounds like a single
syllable), but it features it all the time. The amount of words that end
in a vowel in Spanish makes it very likely to link two words whenever
the second one starts with a vowel. But the effect exists also with
consonants (for example “el libro” sounds like “elibro”).</p>
<p>Your usual book to learn Spanish will not explain this, but it’s by
far the most challenging feature when it comes to understanding spoken
Spanish.</p>
<p>My advice for you is that you bear this in mind and put special
attention to it since the beginning. If I told you to start with
phonetics since the beginning (and I did tell you that), then this is
the key thing to start with regarding phonetics. The sooner you practice
speaking the words like that, the faster your brain will get used to
listening to them the same way.</p>
<p>And if you’re a grammar nerd, you can practice splitting syllables in
Spanish as an exercise that will help you (the rules are much less
ambiguous than in English, so you’ll actually feel rewarded soon).</p>
