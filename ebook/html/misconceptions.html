<h1>Misconceptions</h1>
<p>The more languages you learn, the easier it is to learn a new
language. Is this because you trained specific parts of your brain?
Certainly to some extent. But another major factor are misconceptions:
if it’s your first time learning a language other than English, you’re
extremely likely to frame any new knowledge into your “English
mindset”.</p>
<p>But languages are different in their phonetics, their grammar, the
way sentences are built, etc If you think you’ll learn a new language by
simply learning new words repeatedly, you’ll encounter many
difficulties.</p>
<p>You’re lucky, as Spanish is not <em>that</em> different from English,
but it will still be a pain if you default to framing it into the
English rules. Even parts of the language that are simpler than in
English will be hard for you if you don’t realize they are!</p>
<p>Throughout this book, I’ll show what parts of Spanish will be a real
test for the English learner, but also in which parts you’re better off
forgetting what you know and starting with a cleaner simpler
mindset.</p>
<p>So the first advice I have for you: don’t ask why.</p>
<p>Every language has had centuries of evolution that result in a very
complex set of rules. When something new of the language shocks you,
don’t ask “why is this like that? it makes no sense”. Linguists devote
years of study and research to answer that kind of “why” question, but
your goal here is to just use the language. Don’t try to make a sense of
it or you’ll go crazy.</p>
<p>Some practical questions you can use instead when facing something
shocking could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I find more examples like this?</li>
<li>How can I remember this?</li>
</ul>
