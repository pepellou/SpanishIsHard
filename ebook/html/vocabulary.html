<h1 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h1>
<p>Reading and writing words, as well as knowing their meaning, may not
be as challenging as speaking them out loud or understanding them when
listening. At least not for a word, or a bunch of words. But if you want
to learn thousands of words (and well, you probably want that), then
vocabulary definitely becomes the biggest effort.</p>
<p>You’re lucky many Spanish words will resemble some English words due
to a common origin, but even similarities may sometimes deceive you. In
the end there’s no way around studying vocabulary: you’ll need to learn
word by word.</p>
<p>You may be upset that there’s no shortcut for this, but I’ll tell you
this: vocabulary is usually not the reason people quit learning.
Additionally, I’m sure you already know that the amount of words you
need for basic conversation is not that much. You can get to speak the
basics very soon, and then keep learning new vocabulary all the
time.</p>
<p>So let’s make a deal here. I’ll trust you’re here motivated to take
on the challenge. And you trust me as I tell you how to do it
efficiently.</p>
<p>The key concept here is “sustainable pace”. No matter how clever you
are, you won’t be a good pianist if you don’t practice your scales every
day. You won’t be a good chess player if you don’t practice your tactics
every day. And so on…</p>
<p>A little effort every day will make a huge difference compared to a
big effort once in a while.</p>
<p>Think about it. If I tell you now that “soso” is the Spanish word for
“bland”, you will probably remember it if I ask you in 5 minutes. If I
ask you tomorrow, maybe you’ll remember maybe you won’t, but if I ask
you in a month and you never used the word again, you won’t remember
it.</p>
<p>When we learn new words we don’t want them stored in our short-term
memory, but in our long-term one. The way to move them there?
Repetition.</p>
<p>The efficient way is to use what’s called “spaced repetition”, which
is a scientific way to say that each word will be repeated more
frequently on your first attempts or when you fail to remember them. If
you recall it correctly, the next time you’ll be asked that word will be
in a longer time. If you fail to recall it, you’ll be asked that word
relatively soon again.</p>
<p>Most languages apps (Duolingo, Mondly, Babel, …) will handle this for
you to some extent, but you can just use a generic flashcards software
(such as Anki) or the good old physical flashcards. The latter is my
preferred method, because manual exercise (writing) reinforces memory as
well. You can go over your flashcards and make piles with your failures.
Then simply make sure to start each day by reviewing failures before you
learn any new word.</p>
<p>In no time you’ll be remembering words you saw a week or two ago. And
that’s when you’ll know you’re storing them in the right place in your
brain.</p>
<p>Even just 1 or 2 minutes a day can be very effective if you manage to
keep doing it every day.</p>
