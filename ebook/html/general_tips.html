<h1>General tips</h1>
<p>I gave you 2 tips already. Let me summarize them for you:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Don’t ask why. Embrace the differences.</li>
<li>Practice your vocabulary every day, even if it’s only for a
minute.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we dive in concrete topics of the Spanish language, let me
give you a couple more general advices for learning languages in
general:</p>
<h2 id="start-with-phonetics">Start with phonetics</h2>
<p>Even if you don’t understand what they’re saying, it’s of great value
to listen to pop songs, radio stations or TV shows. You may not realize
it, but your brain also learns from things you’re not consciously
understanding. That’s how linguistic immersion works at first. Your
brain will recognize patterns that keep repeating, even if there’s no
conscious effort on making sense of them, and will be more likely to
identify or reproduce them in the future. The same way a dog is taught
new verbal commands by just hearing them along with the corresponding
action, our brain will learn and predict patterns making it more natural
to “flow” through them in the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the more you delay speaking, the harder it’ll
become. Even if you’re silently reading, you’re internally wording what
you read. The sooner you start wording “the right way” (or let’s call it
a “decent-enough way”), the easier it’ll be to keep building on top of
that.</p>
<h2 id="write">Write</h2>
<p>Making conversation involves more challenges than just learning the
vocabulary. After you have a decent sustainable pace learning
vocabulary, you may want to challenge yourself to write a journal, a
fake letter, a book review, etc.</p>
<p>The real struggle of actually expressing “real” things in writing
will level up your learning a lot. Have a dictionary (or google
translate) nearby and don’t worry if writing the simplest of texts takes
you half an hour. The effort is really worth it.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not an activity to do every day, but if you can save
a bit of time per week or every other week, writing is a great exercise
to speed up your learning.</p>
<h2 id="pick-your-favourite-topics">Pick your favourite topics</h2>
<p>When you have so much to learn ahead of you, there’s no unique
learning path. So why not making it the most entertaining?</p>
<p>One thing I like to do when learning a new language is coming up with
a list of 100 sentences I want to learn how to say. But I don’t
necessarily include the usual “basic conversation” stuff. Instead I have
on my list things like “I am a chess player” or “I like math”.</p>
<p>You can get to be very specific with the topics you like and that
will not only be an extra of motivation for you to learn, but you can
also make a good impression very soon. Imagine that after a week of
learning the language you get to say “I am proud of my gardening skills”
(or any other specific thing you come up with). Any listener would think
you’ve been learning the language for a year!</p>
