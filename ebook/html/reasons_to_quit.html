<h1>Reasons to quit</h1>
<p>I don’t want you to quit.</p>
<p>So bear in mind that these are the reasons why most people quit:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wanting results too fast</li>
<li>Trying to be perfect</li>
<li>Feeling it’s too late to learn</li>
<li>Bad experiences</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, if you suffer of any, some or all of those,
there’s more or less nothing I can do. But let me share how I overcame
them in case if helps.</p>
<h2 id="wanting-results-too-fast">Wanting results too fast</h2>
<p>This is a very common “disease”, as we live in a world where
immediacy is valued and practiced more than patience. The same as many
other “big” life challenges (play an instrument, learn chess, get in
shape, etc.) it’s nearly impossible to perceive any progress in the
short term. But if you persevere through daily practice, no matter how
little, you’ll be able to see results in the long-term.</p>
<p>I’m a very patient person and yet the first week with a new daily
routine is always tough. You just have to start with good
motivation.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-be-perfect">Trying to be perfect</h2>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with trying to be perfect… as long as it’s not
your final goal. It’s important to realize you cannot master a new
language the way you master your native one, and that’s ok. It’s also
very important to realize that if you start at 0% and native level is
100%, you will be able to have conversations somewhere between 10% and
20%. Even native speakers make mistakes (think about you on your own
language) and there’s no problem at all to make mistakes, as people will
still understand you.</p>
<p>Of course, perfectionists will have to fight against
self-consciousness. But put yourself in your listener’s shoes - they’re
not judging your language skills, but rather trying to have a
conversation with you. And if any, they’re probably grateful that you’re
making the big effort of learning and trying to speak their
language.</p>
<h2 id="feeling-its-too-late-to-learn">Feeling it’s too late to
learn</h2>
<p>If you’re an adult, it is true that you no longer have the
extraordinary learning abilities of a child’s brain. But what children
have in learning power, they lack in experience, focus, perspective and
deduction. You have a lot of knowledge that will help you with the
task.</p>
<p>Yes, a sponge-like brain would be handy to speed up the learning, but
just the right attitude and perseverance will get you there anyway.</p>
<h2 id="bad-experiences">Bad experiences</h2>
<p>It is possible that you tried to learn this or another foreign
language in the past and you had a bad experience. Sometimes it can be
simply giving up after a tough time trying, and sometimes it can be a
more traumatic experience, like feeling shame or humiliation due to a
poisonous environment.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason is, bad experiences can discourage you from
learning or from taking important steps in the way (such as having fear
of asking questions or having a bad accent). This may not be the most
common cause of quitting (and in my case I honestly never suffered it),
but it can certainly make it really challenging.</p>
<p>An important thing to remember is that if you’re struggling that’s
already a win. It means you’re making the effort and that’s just the
recipe to succeed. You’ll make a lot of mistakes, every day, but that’s
ok - it’s just the way to learn.</p>
