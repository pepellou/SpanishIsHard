<h1>The big challenges</h1>
<p>We can’t know what we don’t know. So don’t you think you know how
hard it’s going to be, or what challenges you will face. Because you
don’t know.</p>
<p>A common mistake for a new learner is to think that Spanish is like
English. You may not think that consciously, but internally your brain
will try to frame the new knowledge according to the only language you
already know. Your brain will think that some parts will be hard just
because they are hard in English (such as spelling, for example, that is
actually much simpler in Spanish). And your brain will pay no attention
at all at those parts that are simple in English (such as verb tenses,
definitely more complex in Spanish).</p>
<p>Those prejudices, conscious or not, will give you a hard time even
with the simplest parts of the language, because you’ll make them more
complicated than they are.</p>
<p>So let me be clear about what’s really going to be difficult for you.
These are going to be your biggest challenges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Spanish is spoken “too fast”</li>
<li>The logic behind similar words is tricky</li>
<li>Spanish has many dialects</li>
<li>The grammar is complex</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else (spelling, gender, omitting pronouns, accents, etc)
will not be as hard as you think (but we will see them also in further
chapters). But those 4 challenges… oh yes, you will struggle with
them.</p>
<p>In any case, it’s best if I tell you up-front about it, so let’s
understand them a bit to at least have a plan.</p>
