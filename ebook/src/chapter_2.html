	<p class="block_26">
		You know that many words in Spanish have a gender.
		It turns out that "house" ("casa") is a she, but "building" ("edificio") is a "he".
		This will be a big obstacle in your way, so let's talk about how to approach gender.
	</p>
	<p class="block_26">
		The most important thing to remember is that it's a <b>grammatical gender</b>, not a semantic one.
		Don't try to attribute femenine or masculine qualities to the words. It'll drive you crazy.
		Your brain will try to come up with rules, but there are no such rules, as it's really arbitrary.
		Your brain will then encounter a lot of exceptions for those made up rules.
		That's exactly the mess we want to avoid when learning.
	</p>
	<p class="block_26">
		For all purposes, grammatical gender could be called with any other random word.
		It's not a semantic inflection, just a grammatical one, it has no meaning.
		Let's call it <b>bender</b> or <b>ender</b>.
